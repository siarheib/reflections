How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes finding a bug much more easy task

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will allow me to revert bad changes much faster.
	Also it will help me to work with other programmer more efficiently.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: changes are complete and logically divided
	Cons: you can lose some of your work in certain cases

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is VCS for code and programs are very often splitted into multiple file 
	which are related to each other so it's often required to change many files 
	at once to implement a change

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log allows us to view the history of changes and git diff allows us 
	to see differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Of course it makes me more confident about changes because now I know 
	that I can return back to normal version anytime and I don't need to 
	keep in mind all the changes I've made so far to be able to rollback them

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Let's change some code :-)
